                <h3>Acknowledgement of Country</h3>
                <p>Canva acknowledges the deep connections of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to Country. We pay our respects to the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, who are the Traditional Owners of the land our offices are on in Surry Hills, Sydney.<br/>
                <br />
                As a visual communications company, we recognise, and are inspired by, the rich traditions of storytelling in the First Nations cultures of Australia.  We also recognise the continuing contributions of indigenous communities around the world. Weâ€™re committed to continually learning from these powerful traditions and amplifying them wherever we can.
